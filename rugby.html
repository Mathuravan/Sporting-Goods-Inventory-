    <h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:50px;color:#FFFF00"> <u> History </u> </h2>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;color: aliceblue">    Rugby's history dates back to the early 19th century when the game was played at Rugby School in England. The sport's defining moment is often attributed to an incident in 1823 when a student named William Webb Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it, giving birth to the handling game of rugby. The Rugby Football Union was formed in 1871 to standardize rules, leading to wider acceptance and international growth. The sport's popularity spread across the world, culminating in the establishment of the International Rugby Football Board in 1886, now known as World Rugby, which oversees international competitions and further development of the sport.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;font-size:50px;color: #FFFF00";><u>Rugby Field </u></h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px;color: aliceblue">The rugby field, also known as the pitch, is a rectangular playing surface where the exhilarating sport of rugby unfolds. It serves as the battleground for two teams of 15 players each, striving for victory. The field is carefully marked with distinct lines, including goal lines, try zones, and a halfway line, which divides the pitch into two equal halves. Kick-offs and restarts occur from the halfway line. Strategically positioned 22-meter and 10-meter lines impact gameplay. Standard dimensions are approximately 100 meters long and 70 meters wide. This vast expanse becomes the stage for players to display their skills, teamwork, and determination, captivating fans worldwide with their thrilling battles on the rugby field.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;font-size:50px;color:#FFFF00"><u>Rules and Regulations for playing</u></h2>
<ul style="font-size: 25px;color: aliceblue">
    <li> Players and Teams: Rugby is played with two teams, each consisting of 15 players on the field at any given time. There are specific rules regarding player positions and substitutions.
	</li>
	<li> Forward Pass: Unlike many other sports, rugby does not allow forward passes. The ball can only be passed backward or laterally (sideways) to maintain continuity of play.
	</li>
	<li> Tackling: Tackling is a fundamental aspect of rugby, but it must be done legally. Players can only tackle the ball carrier below the shoulders and without dangerous actions like high tackles or tackles that lift the player dangerously.
	</li>
	<li> Ruck and Maul: When a player is brought to the ground, a ruck or a maul forms around them. Players must stay on their feet while joining a ruck, and a maul involves players binding onto each other.
	</li>
	<li> Scrum: The scrum is a method of restarting play after certain infractions or stoppages. It involves the forwards from both teams binding together, and the ball is fed into the scrum and contested for by both teams.
	</li>
	<li> Lineout: When the ball goes out of bounds, a lineout is used to restart play. Players lift a teammate to catch the ball thrown in from the touchline.
	</li>
	<li> Points: Points can be scored through various methods. A try, worth five points, is scored by grounding the ball in the opponent's try zone. A conversion, worth two points, is a kick taken after a try. Penalty kicks and drop goals are worth three points each.
	</li>
	<li> Offside and Onside: Players must be onside (behind the last foot of the last teammate) during certain phases of play, such as kick-offs and rucks.
	</li>
	<li> Refereeing: A referee, along with touch judges and a video referee (TMO), ensure the game's fair play and adjudicate on infringements.
	</li>
